# My red magic ball

**Project description**;

This is my red magic ball. Be careful with what you ask and prepare for the unexpected unswer. 
Ask and you shall know. This simple html/css/js project is my own, and i have played with extra content besides regular M8B rules. 
I have tried to make it simple and fun. Some of the names (class) are strange because I was playing with two languages.

**Look of my project**;
1. First place your name
2. Place your question
 - Because if you don't, you won't get the answer.
