# red-magic-ball

**Project description**;

This is my red magi ball. Be careful with what you ask and prepere for the unexped unser. 
Ask and you shall know. 
This simple html/css/js project is my own. I ahve tried to make it simple and fun. Some of the names (class) are strange because I was playing with two languages, but it works for me.
